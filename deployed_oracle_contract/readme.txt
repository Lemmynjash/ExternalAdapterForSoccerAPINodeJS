When you compile and deploy an apiconsumer.sol 
make sure you give the smart contract address som link token



When doing a request fullfillment make sure you have deployed an 
oracle contract using either rinkby,kovan or mainnet address 

From the generated deployed contract you use that kwa toml files

use the node wallet address for settingFullfillment

If you feel like you want to use the same oracle contract go to remix use the 
same dep contract address and key it on At Address
